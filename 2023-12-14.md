## Topics Covered
- Trish’s PowerPoint from 12/8 meeting (which most of us couldn’t attend)
  - Fundraiser recap—we made $50, which has been officially deposited to Chris. There was no method for online payment (Venmo, ApplePay, PayPal, etc.) so in the future we should try to offer that. For our next fundraiser, we’ll try to get the physical flyers up again and also ask professors to post on Discord, and possibly post on social media as well (and involve BC Engagement).
  - Plan for winter break—regular Thursday meeting time will be offered, but optional for everyone to attend. 
  - Possible new officer position: Public Relations Officer. This role would connect with other Bellevue College clubs and create and manage an Instagram account for Biology Club.
  - UW Symposium: [https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/)
  - Year outline:
    - December: Winter break/optional meeting Dec 21
    - January/February: Conduct research and outreach initiatives. Abstract should be completed by mid-January.
    - May: Present our work
  - Discussion regarding whether we need fundraising to publish our paper. No need to pay for an editor. Sometimes study authors have to pay to publish, but that would likely not require club money (there should be other avenues to pay for that).
  - Delta mentions making a website for the club. Could link to it from the BC Student Engagement page.
  - Possible outreach project to high schools (Seattle Raisbeck Aviation; Hazen High School in Renton; Bellevue High School; Newport High School in Newcastle): we could discuss our phylogenetics project with the students.
  - Upcoming fundraising idea: Valentine’s Day? Might be too early if we are busy in January. We could possibly get “fandom” stickers donated for free; pipe cleaner flowers; we could possibly also reach out to the sustainability office for free supplies; bracelets, phone charms, and rings left over from last time.
- Recap of 11/30 meeting
  - On our shared document ([Nature Review Background Research.docx](https://bellevuec.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/BiologyClub2/Shared_Documents/UW_Symposium_2024_COVID-19/Nature_Review_Background_Research.docx?d=w3a4c343c112a48bd8425c7ae14c5798d&csf=1&web=1&e=b3758E)):
    - We should all read the “Tracking the Global Pandemic” section in the Nature.com “[Phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00483-8)” study.
    - We should also read our assigned study. We should make notes, ask questions, etc. in the shared document. 
  - Tentative topic title? Something similar to: “Using phylogenetics and phylodynamics to compare the effectiveness of interventions for Covid-19 across different countries.”
  - Possible parallel project or part of this project: focusing on the biochemical aspects (looking more specifically at the structure of the molecules and the mutations that are happening). 
- Study assignments
  - Douglas study: Jessica
  - Plessis study: Trish
  - Seeman study: Delta
  - Geoghegan study: Oswald
  - Di Giallonardo study: Delta
- Questions we should ask when reading these studies
  - Who are the authors?
  - What were the methodologies they used?
  - What is the study location/region?
  - What was the particular COVID strain?
  - What was the time period?
  - Were there any interventions put into place in that region at the time of research?
  - Were there any research biases?
  - Is there data published? Can we use it? (Trish’s study has a lot of graphs, etc.) We can also look at the Supplementary Information at the bottom of these studies to find the tree data. Also look for accession numbers.
- Review the SEIS model (Susceptible -> Exposed -> Infectious -> Recovered) and associated rates (represented by Greek letters). Also the BDEI (Birth-Death-Exposed-Infectious) model.
