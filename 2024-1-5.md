## Topics Covered
- Recap of meetings over the holiday break
  - We went through the research papers and created a document that tracks the papers and who they are assigned to for review.
  -	We should read through our article and look for keywords, potential research biases, data sets, etc.
  -	Our goal is to get an idea of what our research question should be (one suggestion: which intervention might have worked best globally). 
- Zoom link
  - We need to establish a student Zoom link for meetings because Dr. Alvares might not be able to join for the whole time. Delta will take that on.
- Treasurer role
  - Alex is our new treasurer üòä
  - We need to update the official document for Biology Club with Alex‚Äôs info.
  -	Delta will email Chris about adding Alex in as treasurer (and will CC Alex).
- Fundraising
  -	At this time, we probably don't need more fundraising, but we could in the future if our paper is closer to being accepted. 
  -	Even from a non-monetary perspective, fundraising is helpful in terms of getting the name of the Biology Club out there.
- Recruiting new members
  - There is a Bellevue College ‚Äútabling event‚Äù on Wednesday, January 10 from 11am-1pm. The deadline to sign up is Sunday (two days from today). Even if we can't have someone there in person the whole time, we could put up a poster and sign-up sheet. (Trish and later Oswald agreed to be there.)
  -	The QR code from the recruiting posters is no longer working. Jory says Google only lets you use it free for 1 month and then it expires. Maybe we should add sticky notes or update the poster with a new QR code.
  -	Giveaways: we have left-overs from the fundraiser that we could use as freebies to entice new members.
  - In the future, we could also host a fun biology-themed event of some kind and advertise it to the campus.
  -	As a recruiting point, we should also emphasize how beneficial Biology Club involvement is for pre-med students (research, club participation, etc.)
  -	Dr. Alvares can also speak to a couple of professors to see if Biology Club can be mentioned in their classes (for example, in biology, anatomy & physiology, and chemistry courses).
  -	We could also make a Canva flyer to include in the Bulldog student engagement newsletters.
- Abstract
  - The abstract is due February 8.
  -	Ideally, we would have the research question solidified by the end of next week.
  -	We could do two different sets of data (one about pandemic response policies, and one about genetic evolution of COVID). We could do two different working groups to help achieve this.
  -	Our best data would be adding onto work that's previously been done. Ideally, we would look at the tree files from various papers, run some Python code on those trees to determine the rate of transmission, and make some comparisons between various locales based on this data. We could assess whether that particular methodology had a predictive effect or not. 
  -	We should look at the ‚ÄúSupplemental Materials‚Äù section at the end of each paper and see if there's a link to a GitHub (or similar) repository containing trees.
  -	By next week, we should determine:
    - Does the paper include a tree with a significant data set that is publicly available?
    - Is it on GitHub? If not, where is it hosted?
    -	What was the tree showing?
