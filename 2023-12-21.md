## Topics Covered
- Discussion on where to find normalized data for our project.
  - It may be too difficult to bring all the data into a single analysis; it may be better to focus on smaller nations (especially island nations) and look at general trends instead.
  - A comparison of lockdowns also might be challenging because they occurred at different times, when the pandemic was at different stages; we do not have independent replicates of the same process, so it can't be looked at in the same way as a controlled experiment can.
- Jory is stepping down as treasurer, so we need to find a replacement.
- Boston study review ("[Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Boston...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33303686/)")
  - Superspreading events—one person infects many others. This study examines how importations (that is, infections not from the state of Massachusetts) and superspreading events affected transmission rates in Boston. Travel restrictions came into play between the "Early" and "Middle Time Period" in the figure.
  - The use of the word "inferred" means it wasn't a definitive empirical observation; instead, it was determined based on a model.
  - "Ancestral state" is where the strain came from.
  - Phylogenetic trees are typically hypotheses based on inferences. In the phylogenetic tree in this study, you can look at the color of an infection's ancestor and its geographic state and determine whether it was imported or not.
  - It's difficult to talk about strains being related to other strains in a precise way because a strain does not have direct evolutionary history the same way that a single individual sequence does. (Similar to how you can precisely identify a person's individual family tree—parents, grandparents, etc.; but when you try to "zoom out," it’s more difficult and less precise to talk about how whole human populations are related to each other.) Therefore, when we build a phylogenetic tree, we put in individual sequences.
  - A "strain" is a general model of many replicas of a virus; strains themselves don’t directly evolve, the individual viruses do.
  - The pink on the model suggests that the hypothetical ancestor to the Boston strains may be from Europe.
  - ML = maximal likelihood. In the probabilistic model for geographic transmission, the ML is the point at which you have the maximum probability of observing the data you did under the model. Bayesian approach looks more at a cluster of hypotheses.
  - Augur pipeline = uses Nextstrain. This is also an ML approach.
  - We probably won't find our own strain and do our own analysis of it; we'll probably just do one analysis and have multiple people replicate the effort and make sure they can also get it to work (that way it's more of a learning experience for us).
- Scheduling for next quarter
  - Delta will put together a When2Meet calendar for us to fill in our availability.
