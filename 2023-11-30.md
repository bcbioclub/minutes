## Topics Covered
- Recap of 11/29 fundraiser
  - Sticker sheets and bracelets were popular
  - Ideas for next time: dorm room items (blankets, posters, school supplies); baked goods
  - Not everyone had cash, so it would be good next time if we had a way for them to pay electronically (Venmo, etc.)
  - Alex commented it would be good to have at least 3 months of lead time before the next fundraiser.
- Biology Club meeting times for next quarter
  - Dr. Alvares will be free most afternoons and Wednesdays, but not Thursdays; if we email her, she’ll confirm her open times for next quarter.
- Biology Club GitHub
  - Oswald put a list of tasks in the chat for us to start looking at.
    - We need a nicer logo/icon for Bellevue College Biology Club in GitHub. Dr. Alvares put an idea in the chat (DNA + organisms). Oswald suggested RNA.
    - Our GitHub is listed as private, but Oswald is now making it public so people outside of Bellevue College can view it.
    - Repositories: 
       - A repository for minutes (written in Markdown; only we can edit the minutes, but viewers can also propose edits).
       - A repository for 2024 UW Symposium information.
    - We also have a 2024 UW Symposium project (different from the repository), which includes the **Opportunities** tab (i.e., tasks) and the **Progress Board** tab (**To-do** vs. **In Progress** vs. **Done**).
    - Current tasks on the **Opportunities** tab:
      - **Select Research Poster Topics**: this is **In Progress** since we’ve been discussing it
      - **Logo needed for Bellevue Bioclub**
      - **Data on covid19 lockdown comparisons**
      - **Data on covid19 mask policy comparison**
      - **Data on covid19 DNA compared with vaccination rates**
      - **Abstract first draft**
      - **Abstract second draft**
- Studies
  - Nature.com study (“[Phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00483-8)”)
    - This is a good paper to open up and look at because it has a lot of citations, so we can find sources for what we’re interested in.
    - Arman will assign us each a section of this paper and we should read this section along with one of the linked sources in our section.
    - We should also all read the “Tracking the Global Pandemic” section.
  - BioRxiv study (“[Analysis of the Dynamics and Distribution...](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.381228v1)”)
    - GISAID references mean we should be able to find accessible datasets on those studies.
  - Douglas study (“[Phylodynamics reveals the role of human travel...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34527282/)”)
    - Move this one to the top of the list because it looks useful for our purposes.
  - Plessis study (“[Establishment and lineage dynamics...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33419936/)”)
    - Move up toward the top as well.
  - Lemieux study (“[Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Boston highlights...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33303686/)”)
    - Move up toward the top as well.
- Ideally, we should have our first draft of the abstract by January 15.
- We decided against using GitHub for our shared notes; it’s too unwieldy. Instead, we’ll use SharePoint: [Nature Review Background Research.docx](https://bellevuec.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/BiologyClub2/Shared_Documents/UW_Symposium_2024_COVID-19/Nature_Review_Background_Research.docx?d=w3a4c343c112a48bd8425c7ae14c5798d&csf=1&web=1&e=b3758E)
